/// A stream of values over time for a single variable.
///
/// A chronology stores timestamped values where the timestamp
/// is when the new value was set.
///
/// ## Values
///
/// Values stored within a `Chronology` must implement the `Copy`
/// trait. Values are copied when they are stored within the
/// `Chronology`. For this reason, it is typically advisable to
/// keep them simple and easy to copy if you're dealing with
/// large numbers of values and need the highest levels of
/// performance.
///
/// ## Nature of Timestamps
///
/// Timestamps are represented as unsigned 64 bit integer values.
/// The exact interpretation of this value is up to the producer
/// and consumer of the data.
///
/// Typical interpretations might be:
///
/// * 1 unit is 1 second.
/// * 1 unit is 1 millisecond.
/// * 1 unit is 1 nanosecond.
/// * 1 unit is 10 nanoseconds.
/// * 1 unit is 100 picoseconds.
///
/// Timestamps may also be interpreted as being an absolute point
/// in time or a relative point in time, again up to the application
/// producing and consuming the data.
///
/// Some applications may be happy tracking number of seconds since
/// 1900. Others are using timestamps that correspond to the number
/// of nanoseconds since the application started or the CPU was
/// powered on.
///
/// ## Inserting Values
///
/// Values are inserted in bulk via `Chronology::insert_values`.
/// `Entry` wraps values along with their timestamp.
///
/// ```
/// use chronostore::{Chronology, Entry, NullSummary};
///
/// let mut chrono = Chronology::<f32, NullSummary<f32>>::new();
/// chrono.insert_values(&[Entry::new(0, 0.3),
///                        Entry::new(5, 0.5)]);
/// ```
///
/// ## Querying Values
///
/// A `Chronology` can be queried for the current value at any point in
/// time. It will find either the last value set prior to the point in
/// time by searching with `Direction::Backward` or the next value that
/// has been set by searching with `Direction::Forward`.
///
/// ```
/// use chronostore::{Chronology, Direction, Entry, NullSummary};
///
/// let mut chrono = Chronology::<f32, NullSummary<f32>>::new();
/// chrono.insert_values(&[Entry::new(0, 0.3),
///                        Entry::new(5, 0.5)]);
///
/// assert_eq!(chrono.find_nearest_value(4, Direction::Forward),
///            Some(Entry::new(5, 0.5)));
/// ```
